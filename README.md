## Introduction

`mathlib` is an effort to provide a native math library for Rust, which covers multiple domains of mathematics. At this moment, this library is a work-in-progress, but I hope to make this library a _stable reality_ in the near future.

## Stability

This library is currently under development, which implies that there may be unpredictable changes to the public API.

## License

This library is distributed under the permissive [Apache-2.0 License](./LICENSE).
